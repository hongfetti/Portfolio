          My name is Ryan Hong and I'm a recently certified full stack web developer with a background in higher education from Wilfrid Laurier University. With a strong foundation in both front-end and back-end technologies, I bring a balanced, solution-oriented approach to web development that prioritizes clean code, intuitive design, and functionality.<br /><br />

          I thrive on solving complex problems and enjoy building user-friendly applications that make a difference. My passion for development is matched by a lifelong interest in sports and gamingâ€”two areas that have shaped how I think about teamwork, strategy, and immersive user experiences.<br /><br />

          Whether I'm coding a sleek user interface or architecting a scalable API, I'm always eager to learn, iterate, and create. I'm currently seeking opportunities to contribute to collaborative, innovative teams where I can continue to grow as a developer and make a meaningful impact.<br />
